With 5+ years of experience as a DevSecOps and Platform Engineer and degrees in Mathematics and Physics, I help companies introduce security into every step of their workflows and build platforms that improve the productivity of their development teams.

Based in Vienna, Austria, I partner with forward-thinking companies on complex projects that show their drive for innovation and security.

A special focus is placed on the use of an open source and portable technology stack to avoid vendor lock-in and to be able to shift resources as fast as possible to reduce downtime. This ensures that workloads run on Azure, AWS, GCP or any other cloud provider and on-premise.

Taking on projects with innovative companies that are ready to take the extra step towards security and/or a platform for their developers, I can deliver the deep expertise and focused attention that these companies deserve and expect.
