# DevSecOps

{{< image src="images/devsecops.jpeg" caption="" alt="" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title=""  webp="" >}}

In the conventional Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), security testing was a seperate process and the security team discovered security flaws only after the software was built. The DevSecOps framework shifts security to the left, in between development and operations, hence the **shift-left** paradigm. The benefits this framework provides are to

- catch software vulnerabilites early
- reduce time to marked
- ensure regulatory compliance
- build a security-aware culture
- develop new features securely

This means that security is implemented in every step of the SDLC and that security is a shared responsibility among all team members who are involved in building the software. As a result, your company delivers secure software faster while also ensuring compliance.

In order to secure every step of your Software Development Lifecycle and to make security a shared responsibility, I help you introduce automation and security in your workflows step by step.

{{< accordion "Continuous Integration" >}}
When developers commit changes to your codebase multiple times a day, Continuous Integration (CI) is a necessity in order to automatically perform all your tests. By integrating security best practices into your CI build pipelines, your developers can catch integration issues, bugs and security risks early in the process rather than waiting until the end of your workflows.

**I help you build secure Continuous Integration pipelines from the ground up or within your existing infrastructure to enable development teams to find integration issues, bugs and security risks early.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Continuous Delivery" >}}
Continuous Delivery (CD) builds upon your Continuous Integration (CI) workflows to move from your build environment to a staging environment. In addition to unit testing, additional components like the user interface, APIs and the expected traffic volumes are automatically tested. By including *Interactive Application Security Testing*, *Dynamic Application Security Testing* and *Container Scanning*, security can be baked into the whole process to strengthen your trust when you extend your CD workflow to automatically deliver the secure, tested and production-ready code to customers.

**I help you build secure Continuous Delivery workflows from the ground up or within your existing infrastructure to enable you to ship secure, tested and production-ready code to your customers.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Continuous Security" >}}
It is important to build security into the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), so it is important to start threat modeling early in the process and automate security testing throughout the entire SDLC. This already starts with development environment of your developers and ends with the monitoring of your released software for security risks and bugs. By implementing security into every step of the SDLC and by testing your software for security risks early and frequently, you can efficiently ship secure software by minimizing risks.

**I help you with threat modeling throughout your Software Development Process to maximize security and minimize risk.** 
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Infrastructure as Code" >}}
Provisioning infrastructure that matches your requirements is a vital step in efficiently running your entire software stack. It is equally important to automate this process as much as possible in order to reduce errors and enforce consistency. As with your application code, also your infrastructure code can and needs to be tested and checked for security risks. Furthermore, tools like *infracost* can help you to plan your budget and avoid unnecessary spending.

**I help you automate the provisioning of infrastructure with code and to enable you to consistently deploy environments and to scale your infrastructure for every workload.**

{{< accordion "Workshops" >}}
It does not matter if you are thinking about creating introducing Security into your DevOps workflows and don't know where to start, or if you have already started with a few components but don't know if you are on the right track. Sometimes a workshop is the perfect way to talk about ideas, learn new things and try out different concepts. They are also a great place where DevOps teams can gather feedback or requirements from different development teams to start or continue their journey in securing their whole workflow.

**I offer workshops for teams in every stage of their DevSecOps journey by providing insights and expertise to enable them to implement security best practices in every step of the Software Development Lifecycle.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Building a DevSecOps Team" >}}
Building up a DevSecOps team by providing guidance and architecture decisions is hard and can be overwhelming. However, it is vital for the acceptance and success of security best practices in every step of the Software Development Lifecycle. Furthermore, it is important to introduce a step-by-step mindset from the beginning and to rapidly improve on feedback from development teams in order to establish CI/CD pipelines that test your code, enable your teams to discover security risks fast and ship them to your customers.

**I help you build up a DevSecOps team that implements security into every step of your Software Development Lifecycle and enables teams to build secure, tested and production-ready software releases.**

# Platform Engineering

{{< image src="images/platform-engineering.jpeg" caption="" alt="" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title=""  webp="" >}}

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) of a product can range from pretty straight forward to very complex. Therefore, it is important to free your development teams from problems they should not be dealing with. Developers should not need to figure out

- what version of Python the project uses
- what pipeline template are they are supposed to use
- how to get all their tests to run automatically at every pull request
- how to run this application on a kubernetes cluster
- how to provision their development infrastructure

These tasks can frustrate and demotivate your development and operations teams but also waste valuable time as multiple people from different teams are needed to clear up those questions. Furthermore, by isolating development and operations teams, there is a clear disconnect of the **"you build it, you run it"** paradigm of DevOps. This is where Platform Engineering comes into play.

> Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application.

In order to free your development teams from tasks that take away their focus from building amazing new software releases, I help you to build up your platform step by step.

{{< accordion "Internal Developer Platform (IDP)" >}}
No two companies are the same so Internal Developer Platforms will always be a custom solution, specifically developed to enhance developer productivity with self-service portals. In fact, they are meant to be. However, they are also meant to have comprehensive documentation for onboarding and continuous learning. If treated as an internal product, the IDP is driven by the feedback of the development teams that use it and know its value.

**I help you develop a custom Internal Developer Platform that creates a streamlined path from conception to deployment into a golden path.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Custom Tooling" >}}
In every development and operations team comes the time when your workflows are in contrast with the intended way of using your (open source) solutions and when you need build custom tooling to fully take advantage of all the possibilites the (open source) solution has to offer. However, often times, instead of investing time and resources to develop these custom resources, a quick and fragile workaround is implemented which no one dares to touch after a time.

**I help you develop custom tooling that fits into your development workflow and takes full advantage of your (open source) solutions.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Workshops" >}}
It does not matter if you are thinking about creating an Internal Developer Platform and don't know where to start, or if you have already started with a few components but don't know if you are on the right track. Sometimes a workshop is the perfect way to talk about ideas, learn new things and try out different concepts. They are also a great place where platform teams can gather feedback or requirements from different development teams and advertise themselves and their value internally to make sure that a platform is a valuable investment.

**I offer workshops for teams in every stage of their platform engineering journey by providing insights and expertise to enable them to build an Internal Developer Platform which their developers love.**
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Building a Platform Team" >}}
Building up a platform team by providing guidance and architecture decisions is hard and can be overwhelming. However, it is vital for the acceptance and success of your platform in other teams. Furthermore, it is important to introduce a step-by-step mindset from the beginning and to rapidly improve on feedback from development teams in order to establish the platform team as a necessary part of the "you build it, you run it" philosophy.

**I help you build up a platform team that creates value for the development teams and enables them to truly embrace the "you build it, you run it" paradigm.**

# Ready to secure your workflows and to enable your developers?

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "Alignment" >}}
Let's have a focused conversation about your workflows, needs and vision. Contact me via the [Contact](/contact) page to schedule a **30-minute** Introduction Call where we'll

- discuss your specific challenges
- discuss availability
- determine if there's a potential fit

Picture this as a **get-to-know-you** call without any obligations. Ideally, we move to the **Alignment** phase where we can have a longer and more in-depth discussion about how I can help your company to secure your workflows and to enable your developers. If you are not located in Vienna, this will also most likely be online. After the alignment, it should be clear if we want to move forward to the **Clarification** phase and what budget we are working with.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Clarification" >}}
The **Clarification** phase consists of one or more **Clarification Workshops** that can range from half-days to full-days in length where we

- align stakeholders
- align business objectives
- gather requirements and visions from different teams
- define first milestones

This phase is for everyone to be on the same page and align expectations in order to deliver a product every team can see a part of themselves in. It is essential for the actual start of the project and the **Project** phase.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Project" >}}
In the **Project** phase the actual work towards the milestones happens. Depending on the milestones, the project structure and the team structure, this can vary in shape and form which has all been defined in the **Clarification** phase. Depending on the size of the project, this can run from a few months to a year. You will get

- completed and tested milestones
- knowledge transfer and documentation
- final report of the project

This concludes the project and opens the door to repeat the cycle with another **Clarification** phase and new requirements.
